            Welcome to my projects page! Here, I showcase the work I've done across
            various domains like web development, design, and other creative pursuits.
            However, this page is currently under construction. Iâ€™ll be updating this page regularly as
            I complete or make progress on various projects. I am still working on
            updating my older projects and will be adding them here soon.
          </p>

          <p>
            The website you are currently on, <b className="text-cyan-400">PandaHome</b>, is my ongoing project. I'm
            actively working on its development and plan to update this section with
            details about <b className="text-cyan-400">PandaHome</b> and other projects once they're ready.
          </p>

          <p>
            I appreciate your patience and understanding. As I continue building out
            this site and its features, check back later for more updates on my work.
            In the meantime, feel free to explore my <a href="/blog" className="text-pink-600 hover:text-pink-700">Blog</a> to see my latest thoughts and projects.
